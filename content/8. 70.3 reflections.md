Title: 70.3 Reflections Published: 09/17/2024 Lead: Race report and reflecting on my DNF at my first Iron Man 70.3. 
---


## tl;dr
I came up short in my first Ironman 70.3, earning a DNF (Did Not Finish) during the bike portion of the race. Three hours and 23 minutes in, with less than eight miles to go, the local police pulled me over as they opened traffic back up.
I was under the impression I had 4 hours and 30 minutes for the bike—standard for 70.3 races—so I paced myself accordingly, keeping an average heart rate of 110, saving my energy for the run, where I felt strongest.
Complaining won’t undo the DNF, but I won’t ignore that I put myself in this position. This experience has me rethinking my training and how I set my goals. I need to step it up to meet my goals.

## Race report
Race day threw a curveball. We were prepped for 70°F weather, but instead, we faced 50°F temps, 23 mph wind gusts, and nonstop rain.


My weakest event, the swim, went about as expected. I started in the last group off the dock, nerves and excitement buzzing through me. After some deep breaths to calm down, we finally started 16 minutes after the hour. There was a moment of panic when I lost depth perception, making me feel like I was drowning. Some slow, controlled breathing brought me back and I managed to finish the swim in just under an hour.

I was happy with my first transition, managing to strip off my wetsuit without much hassle—a win for me. But that high faded when I realized my fingers were numb from the cold. I fumbled through my transition bag, tearing it open to grab my cycling gear. Skipping nutrition at this point felt like the best move—my fingers were too cold to deal with opening packages anyway.


The bike leg started rough. Due to the wet conditions, I lost one of my nutrition bottles less than 5 minutes into the leg. Already behind, I figured I’d push to the aid station that was at mile 10 rather than turning back. But then, nausea hit. I pulled over and vomited, then got back on my bike. To add to the situation, my jacket, which I had thrown on during transition, was soaked through from the rain in minutes. The idea of riding 56 miles in those conditions felt impossible. I seriously thought about quitting. But I talked myself into pushing to the halfway point.
I vomited two more times in the next 30 minutes, but by the third round my nausea seemed to clear up. By the halfway point, I was cold and soaked but surprisingly optimistic. I was laughing to myself. All I had to do was survive two more hours, and I’d be in my element with the run.
That’s when I made my mistake. I got too comfortable, assuming I had plenty of time. Less than eight miles from the finish, I heard sirens. A local officer pulled up behind me, yelling instructions in Serbian. I looked around, confused, and asked another rider what was happening. He told me, “He’s saying time’s out.”
I was stunned. I checked my watch—11:50. I thought we had until 12:30? I protested, but it didn’t matter. The race officials had their orders.
My race ended not just because of the poor conditions, but because I hadn’t trained hard enough to avoid being in this situation. I got complacent, training just enough to finish but I didn’t account for the unexpected. 



## Reflections
On the surface, I’ve been here before—setting an ambitious goal, giving it my all, and then coming up short. It’s part of the territory when you push yourself, but this recent experience highlighted something different: is my goal ambitious enough?

In 2021, I attempted to summit Mt. Rainier. I failed. Three years later, in 2024, I was part of the first team to summit that year. Physically, I had been prepared on both attempts. But my first attempt taught me that mountaineering isn’t just about physical endurance. It’s about managing emotional stress: high winds, whiteouts, and the mental toll of days spent kicking into the mountain’s icy slope. I wasn’t ready for that.

The Ironman 70.3, though, was different. My failure wasn’t about being unprepared—it was about not setting a challenging enough goal. My target was simply to finish. I didn’t imagine myself crossing the finish line with a smile, or even at a specific time. I visualized completing the race, and that’s how I trained: just enough to finish.

That’s where I missed the mark.
A useful framework for understanding this comes from personal development theory—the idea of a “growth edge.” Your abilities grow as a function of how much stress you’re able to manage. We all have comfort zones, where we operate without much challenge. Then there’s the discomfort zone, where growth happens as we take on new stress and expand our capacity.
The more time you spend on that edge, the more it shifts outward, until today’s discomfort becomes tomorrow’s new normal.

There are a few different ways to approach expanding your growth edge.

One method is optimization: focus intensely on one area of development while intentionally reducing stress in others. This keeps your overall stress levels constant. For example, if you’re prioritizing a high-stakes work project, you might pull back on social commitments to make room for the extra hours at the office.

Alternatively, you could attempt to grow multiple areas of your life simultaneously, but this often leads to burnout. Think about New Year’s resolutions: “I’m going to work out X hours a week, read Y books a month, and crush Z projects at work.” More often than not, we fail to achieve any of those because we spread ourselves too thin.

The third approach, and the one I find most compelling, is to increase your tolerance for stress incrementally. Instead of reducing pressure in other areas, you push yourself to manage more. It’s not about doing less; it’s about becoming more efficient.
Take training for an Ironman 70.3 as an example. You know you’ll need to train more to handle the race volume, but you don’t want to compromise other parts of your life in the process. The challenge becomes finding ways to fit everything in—training harder and working smarter.

But no matter which model you choose, the critical question is: How much effort do you put in? This is where I went wrong. The effort you invest should be tied to what you want your new normal to look like.

For the Ironman, I aimed to finish. That’s a commendable goal for anyone’s first 70.3, but my training reflected that modest ambition. I did just enough to ensure I could complete the race within the required window, but left little room for error. If something unexpected happened—fatigue, injury, or a bad weather day—I wouldn’t have had the buffer to recover.

To hedge against that, I should have set a more ambitious goal. Finishing in six hours, for example, would have driven me to train at a higher intensity, giving me the margin of safety I needed to handle the unexpected.

I wasn’t ambitious enough with my goal—and that’s the lesson.

So, what’s next? I’m not leaving it to chance. For my next Ironman 70.3 attempt, I’m setting a goal that stretches me. A goal ambitious enough to ensure that I not only finish but finish strong.
